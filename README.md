                                                      How The Game Works

Upon running the script, the programme prompts you to ask how many pax want to play the game and what is the standard buy-in for each player. It proceeds to ask for your Name and provides you with an ID. 

Subsequently 2 cards are drawn.

Upon seeing the 2 cards you can choose to play or pass. 

If you choose to play, the programme asks you how much you want to bet, the bet cannot be more than the total amount in the pot, for obvious reasons. 

After this, the third card is drawn. 

If the numerical value of the third card lies within that of the first 2 cards, you win and u draw the amount you bet from the pot. If numerical value of the third card lies outside the value of the first 2 cards i.e (its value being the least or the greatest of the 3 cards, you lose and deposit your bet into the pot.)

However, if the value of the third card drawn happens to be equal to the value of either of the 2 first cards you have to deposit twice the amount you bet, into the pot, this is called hitting the post.

The final note would be that Suit holds no weight in this game i.e ( 4 Of clubs == 4 Of Spades ), this is how the game is usually played.
